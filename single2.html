                    on Sunday as Luis Suarez scored the hattrick that will surely spell the end
                    of Julen Lopetegui's time as Real Madrid coach.
                </p>

                Barcelona were dominant at the Camp Nou for all-but a 15-minute period after half-time when the
                otherwise hapless
                Madrid threatened a comeback.


                All the failures that have underlined their recent problems under Lopetegui were on show here, poor
                finishing, dreadful
                defending and key players performing well below par, let alone at their best.

                There was also some bad luck, as Luka Modric hit the post at 2-1, while Suarez's second was a
                penalty, awarded only
                after consultation with the Video Assistant Referee.

                Philippe Coutinho scored the first and Arturo Vidal finished a late flurry but in between the game
                belonged to Suarez,
                who terrorised Madrid and made light of Lionel Messi's absence.

                But Suarez was not writing off Madrid, adding: "Every player and every team can suffer a poor game
                and a poor
                performance. You just have to keep trying and pulling together as a team. These are situations you
                can understand. They
                can happen to everyone."

                The teaser doesn't show much more than Cavill so we still are in the dark as to what to expec.
                <div class="info">
                    "[Messi] is the best in the world, always a plus," Suarez said. "But what we've done is shown
                    the level of football
                    this team is capable of. We're behind the manager and we love the club.

                    "They came out [after half-time] obviously wanting to turn the game around," he said. "They
                    made it 2-1, they had a
                    couple of chances."

                </p>
                "A defeat is always hard, even more so against Barcelona," he said. "The result does not reflect the
                reality of the
                match, it seemed excessive.

                "We were much better in the second half, had a moment to get back into the game, had many chances to
                score, hit the
                post. But it did not happen, and more misfortunes arrived, more injuries, and third goal ended our
                hopes, and the
                punishment at the end was excessive.</p>

                    He also insisted that he had the strength to continue with the job.

                    "We have had such bad luck over these weeks, but all runs come to an end. And I am sure the team
                    will show another
                    face.

                    "We are in October. This is reversible with the time we have and I see myself with the strength to
                    do so. The team is
                    alive yet. I feel sad, but with the strength to continue."
